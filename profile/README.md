## Method
The 3 algorithm we will be using are:

- Logistic regression: The logistic regression is a very common algorithm used for binary problem. It uses a sigmoid function f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x)) to model the probability of the target variable with the input x. The model can be implemented in Tensorflow using a single dense layer with a sigmoid activation.
- Linear Regression: The linear regression is also a very common algorithm used for binary classification problem. It uses a linear function y = b0 + b1 * x â€¢ y represents the dependent variable we want to predict. â€¢ x represents the independent variable. â€¢ b0 is the y-intercept, which is the value of y when x is 0. â€¢ b1 is the slope of the line, representing the change in y for a one-unit increase in x. This can also be implemented as a Tensorflow model using a single dense layer with a linear activation function.
- Deep learning: The Deep learning algorithm is a more advanced algorithm which contains multilayers of fully connected neural network. The input layer receives the input and then passes them to next layers which are called the hidden layers. Each layers in the hidden layer consist of multiple neurons or units. Each neurons in the hidden layers then applies a weighted sum of the inputs after which an activation function is also applied to give an output. The weighted sum of the input is calculated by weighted sum = (input (1) * weight (1)) + (input (2) * weight (2)) + ... + (input (n)* weight (n)) + bias. The final layer which is the output layer then receives the outputs from the last layer in the hidden layers. The number of neurons in the final layer depends on the classification task. In a binary classification task a single neuron or unit with sigmoid activation function is used in the output layer. Whereas in a non-binary classification problem the number of neurons in the output layer is equal to the total number of classes and a softmax activation function is used in this case.
